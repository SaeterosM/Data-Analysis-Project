# Consumer Behavior Analysis

## Project Overview
I used a consumer behavior dataset in SQL to extract and organize data into Excel, which was then used to create a dashboard in Tableau. The process, including data cleaning and visualization, took approximately 5 hours.

## Questions:
I utilized a consumer behavior dataset to analyze trends and gather insights to support business decision-making based on various factors such as trends, demographics, and preferences.
